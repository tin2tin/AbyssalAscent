## üéÆ How to Play

You control a bubble striving to reach the surface from the abyssal depths.

*   **Movement:**
    *   **Arrow Left/Right:** Move along the underside of a platform/ceiling you are attached to.
    *   **Mobile "LEFT" / "RIGHT" Buttons:** Same as arrow keys.
*   **Action:**
    *   **Spacebar / Mobile "PUSH" Button:**
        *   When attached to a ceiling: PUSH off to propel yourself downwards (and thus, upwards in buoyancy).
        *   When in open water: Briefly push nearby jellyfish or attempt a quick push-off from a nearby ceiling if close enough.
*   **Objective:**
    *   Collect glowing **Air Bubbles** (gems) to increase your air supply and score. This also slightly increases your player bubble's size.
    *   Attach to the special **"ASCENT"** platform once all air bubbles in a level are collected to progress to the next, shallower depth.
    *   Reach a depth of 0m to win!
*   **Avoid:**
    *   Hitting Angler Fish or being caught by Lurkers.
    *   Bumping into Jellyfish (they will push you around).
    *   Reaching the top surface of the water (a designated death zone near Y=0) or the deadly ocean floor at the very start.
*   **Other Controls:**
    *   **P / Escape / Mobile "PAUSE" Button:** Pause/Resume the game. The pause menu allows you to resume, restart, mute sounds, or return to the surface/close.

        *   Node.js `http-server` package: `npx http-server .`
